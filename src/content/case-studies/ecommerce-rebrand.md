# The Challenge

We needed to modernize the shopping experience while maintaining the brand's established identity. The old site was slow, not mobile-friendly, and had a complicated checkout process.

## The Solution

We implemented a **headless architecture** using:

- Shopify Plus
- Next.js
- Tailwind CSS

### Key Results

1. **40% increase** in mobile conversions
2. **2s reduction** in page load time
3. **15% increase** in average order value

The new design system focuses on clarity and speed.
